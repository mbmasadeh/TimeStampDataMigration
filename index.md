## Data integration based on time stamp using SSIS

To performing a data integration process between two database systems, there will be two methods to do this:
The first method is to do a full data integrastion. Thats means the whole data in database A will be copied and send to database B. Normally, thiis kind of integration process is used for one time only at themost first database integration process.

The second method is a partial data intefgration thats operate between two database systems depending on a condition. However, in this method, only a pointed records inside the database A will be integrated with database B. As an example, the daily fingerprint records for the time attendance system thats required to integrate the daily records only. These daily records can be assigned for a data integration uses using one of the follwing keys:

The first key is the primary key. SSIS has an ability to integrate a records are in database A, but not available yet in database B. By using the "Lookup" tool in SSIS, the data integration service has the ability to make a comparasion between database A with database B and integrate the only missing data thats not available in database B. The "lookup" tool is useless in case if the table is running without a primary key.

The second key is by using the time stamp. By using s select statement thats pointing to a particular datetime, only the records whom matching with that selected datetime will be integrated and copied from database A to database B.  ou can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mbmasadeh/TimeStampDataMigration/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
